Q6. What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

Ans: Both IDs and classes are attributes used to identify and style HTML elements, but they serve different purposes.
     ID:• A unique identifier for a single element on a page.
        • Cannot be reused within the same page.
        • Typically used for JavaScript targeting or unique styling.
        • Defined using id="uniqueID" and referenced in CSS with #uniqueID.
Ex:- <p id="main-heading">This is a unique heading.</p>

Class:- • Can be assigned to multiple elements.
        • Used for grouping elements that share similar styles.
        • Defined using class="classname" and referenced in CSS with .classname.
Ex:- <p class="highlight">This is highlighted text.</p>
<p class="highlight">Another highlighted paragraph.</p>
