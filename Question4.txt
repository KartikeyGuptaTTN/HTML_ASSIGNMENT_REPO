Q4. What is semantic HTML? List some semantic and non-semantic elements.

Ans:-A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Ex:- non-semantic elements: <div> and <span>- Tells nothing about its content.
Ex:- semantic elements: <img>, <header>, <title>, <section> and so on - Clearly defines its content.
