Q5. Why do we use meta tags?

Ans: Meta tags are used to provide additional information about a webpage to search engines and 
     users, helping them understand the content of a page and ultimately improving its visibility 
     in search results by providing key details like page titles and descriptions that appear on 
     search engine result pages (SERPs); essentially, they act as a way to "tell" search engines 
     what a page is about so they can better categorize and rank it.
Ex:-  <head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
